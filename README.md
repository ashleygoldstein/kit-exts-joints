 This extension allows you to create any joint easily and efficiently between two prims in your Omniverse USD stage!

 ## Get Started

 This extension is available in Omniverse Kit and can be installed via the Extensions manager tab. 

 Once you are in the Extensions tab, navigate to the Community tab and search `Joint Connection`.

 Install and Enable the extension and the Joint Connection window will appear.

 ## How to Use

 To use this extension once enabled select your first Prim in the stage and click the `S` button in the Joint Connection window for `Prim A`.

 Then select your second Prim in the stage that you want the joint to be connected with and click the `S` button for `Prim B`.

 In the `Joints` drop down menu, select which joint you want to create.

 Then, click `Create Joint` button.

 :tada: Congratulations! :tada:
 
 You now have a joint! Click the `play` button in Omniverse to test it out.
